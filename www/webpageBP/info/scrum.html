        <h1>Scrum</h1>
        <p>
          Scrum is a framework for agile project management that is used to
          develop software and other products. It is an iterative and
          incremental approach to project management that helps teams deliver
          value to their customers faster and more efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scrum is based on the principles of transparency, inspection, and
          adaptation. It is designed to help teams work together more
          effectively and deliver high-quality products that meet the needs of
          their customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scrum is based on a set of roles, events, and artifacts that help
          teams organize their work and collaborate effectively. Some of the key
          concepts in Scrum include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Scrum Master: The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that the
            Scrum framework is followed and that the team is working
            effectively. They help the team remove any obstacles that are
            preventing them from delivering value to their customers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Product Owner: The Product Owner is responsible for defining the
            product vision and prioritizing the work that needs to be done. They
            work closely with the team to ensure that the product meets the
            needs of the customers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Development Team: The Development Team is responsible for delivering
            the product. They are self-organizing and cross-functional, meaning
            that they have all the skills and expertise needed to deliver the
            product.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sprint: A Sprint is a time-boxed iteration of work that typically
            lasts between 1-4 weeks. During a Sprint, the team works to deliver
            a potentially shippable product increment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Product Backlog: The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of all
            the work that needs to be done on the project. It is managed by the
            Product Owner and is constantly updated to reflect changes in the
            project.
          </li>
          <li>
            Increment: The Increment is the sum of all the work that the team
            has completed during a Sprint. It is a potentially shippable product
            that meets the Definition of Done.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Scrum is a powerful framework that can help teams deliver value to
          their customers faster and more efficiently. It is based on the
          principles of transparency, inspection, and adaptation, and is
          designed to help teams work together more effectively and deliver
          high-quality products that meet the needs of their customers.

        <h2 id="experience">My experience with Scrum</h2>
        <p>
          I attended a theoretical scrum course organized by 42 [&] RBI to get a
          basic knowledge in Scrum
        </p>
        <p>
          I also attended a simulated project where we used Scrum to manage our
          work. We had (daily) stand-up meetings to discuss our progress, sprint
          planning meetings to plan our work for the next sprint, sprint review
          meetings to review our work and get feedback from our stakeholders,
          and sprint retroperspective to improve ourselves.
