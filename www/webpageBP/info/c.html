        <h1>C experience</h1>
        <p>
          One of my first programming language was C. I learned it at 42Vienna.
          Here are some of the projects I did there:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Libft</li>
          <li>get_next_line</li>
          <li>ft_printf</li>
          <li>so_long</li>
          <li>push_swap</li>
          <li>minitalk</li>
          <li>minishell</li>
          <li>philosophers - my favorite project</li>
          <li>cub3D</li>
          <li>ft_shmup</li>
          <li>connect4</li>
          <li>Retro_MFA</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These are some of the projects I did in C. I learned a lot about
          memory management, pointers, and how to write efficient code. I also
          learned how to use the LLDB debugger and valgrind to debug my code and
          check for memory leaks. I also learned how to use the Makefile to
          compile my projects and how to use a graphic library like the MLX
          library from 42
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I really enjoyed working with C and I learned a lot from it.
          I think it's a great language to learn if you want to understand how
          computers work at a lower level and how to write efficient code.
        </p>

        <h3>Philosophers</h3>
        <p>
          Philosophers is a project where you have to solve the dining
          philosophers problem using threads and mutexes. The dining
          philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem in computer
          science where a number of philosophers sit at a table and eat
          spaghetti. The philosophers can only eat if they have both forks and
          they can only pick up one fork at a time. The challenge is to write a
          program that allows the philosophers to eat without causing a
          deadlock.
        </p>
        <p>
          Philosophers is my favorite project at 42 in C. I really liked digging
          in to it and thinking about a logic when multiple processes run in
          paralell and how to make sure that in each case of error all processes
          are stopped and everything is freed properly
        </p>
        <h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the tools I used while working with C:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>LLDB debugger (error searching)</li>
          <li>Valgrind (checking for memory leaks)</li>
          <li>
            Helgrind (checking in multiprocess program for data races and lock
            order problems)
          </li>
          <li>Makefile (for compiling)</li>
          <li>
            42 Mlx (a graphic library we had to use for cub3D and so_long)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the concepts I learned while working with C:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Memory management</li>
          <li>Pointers</li>
          <li>Structures</li>
          <li>Linked lists</li>
          <li>Dynamic memory allocation</li>
          <li>File I/O</li>
          <li>Forks [&] Pipes</li>
          <li>Threads</li>
          <li>Mutexes</li>
          <li>Signals</li>
